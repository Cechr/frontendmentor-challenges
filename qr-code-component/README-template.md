### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learned how to use Flexbox and use some CSS properties.

### Continued development
I want to continue focusing on the use of CSS, Flexbox and CSS Grid to create nice and cool web pages with UX/UI rules and good practices.

### Useful resources
